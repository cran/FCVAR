# FCVAR
An R Package for the Fractionally Cointegrated VAR Model

## Description

Estimation and inference using the Fractionally Cointegrated 
Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. It includes functions for model specification, 
including lag selection and cointegration rank selection, as well as a comprehensive
set of options for hypothesis testing, including tests of hypotheses on the 
cointegrating relations, the adjustment coefficients and the fractional 
differencing parameters. 
See the file ```FCVAR_README.pdf``` for examples
and the Webpage https://sites.google.com/view/mortennielsen/software
for more information about the FCVAR model.

## Release Notes

# August 4, 2021: Fourth submission.

* Added link to reference paper in the DESCRIPTION file. 
* Changed examples with ```\dontrun``` to ```\donttest``` for examples
with run time than took longer than 5s.
* Removed example from demo that changed ```par()``` settings.
* For function ```plot.FCVAR_grid()``` that changes ```par()``` settings, 
because it creates a figure with thinner margins, 
inserted command ```on.exit(par(oldpar))``` to restore user's settings, 
immediately after the change to ```par()```. 


# July 30, 2021: Third submission.

* Excluded examples with ```\dontrun``` if run time took longer than 5s.
