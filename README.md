# FCVAR
An R Package for the Fractionally Cointegrated VAR Model

## Description

Estimation and inference using the Fractionally Cointegrated 
Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. It includes functions for model specification, 
including lag selection and cointegration rank selection, as well as a comprehensive
set of options for hypothesis testing, including tests of hypotheses on the 
cointegrating relations, the adjustment coefficients and the fractional 
differencing parameters. 
See the file ```FCVAR_README.pdf``` for examples
and the Webpage https://sites.google.com/view/mortennielsen/software
for more information about the FCVAR model.


## How to Install FCVAR

Install the latest release using the ```install.packages()``` function:

```
install.packages("FCVAR")
library(FCVAR)
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version on 
GitHub using the ```devtools``` package:

```
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("LeeMorinUCF/FCVAR")
```

However, the version on CRAN is recommended because that version
is tested and vetted for submission to CRAN. 

Currently, the development version has no new features that are 
not already available in the released version available on CRAN. 


## Release Notes

### March 10, 2022: Seventh submission (FCVAR v0.1.2).

* Adjustment for issue with counting the number of free parameters in constrained model. 
* Added warning message for rank test with rank above 12. In this case, 
p-values are only available by simulation with the FCVARbootRank() function. 


### August 6, 2021: Sixth submission (FCVAR v0.1.1).

* For models with restricted estimation, skipped tests on CRAN 
that compare printed output and require exact equality (i.e. without tolerance), 
but retained tests on same with default tolerance for numerical equality. 

### August 5, 2021: Fifth submission (FCVAR v0.1.1).

* Modified tolerance of bootstrap test results for Solaris platforms. 
Test results are within acceptable tolerance. 


### August 4, 2021: Fourth submission (FCVAR v0.1.0).

* Added link to reference paper in the DESCRIPTION file. 
* Changed examples with ```\dontrun``` to ```\donttest``` for examples
with run time than took longer than 5s.
* Removed example from demo that changed ```par()``` settings.
* For function ```plot.FCVAR_grid()``` that changes ```par()``` settings, 
because it creates a figure with thinner margins, 
inserted command ```on.exit(par(oldpar))``` to restore user's settings, 
immediately after the change to ```par()```. 


### July 30, 2021: Third submission (FCVAR v0.1.0).

* Excluded examples with ```\dontrun``` if run time took longer than 5s.


### July 30, 2021: Second submission (FCVAR v0.1.0).

* Added cran-comments.md to .Rbuildignore.



### July 30, 2021,  ```FCVAR_0.1.0```: 

* First submission of the FCVAR package (FCVAR v0.1.0).
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
